loadout
- A program to generate ideal loadouts for Fortnite during Chapter 3, Season 2
- The stats used are based on either the green stats for weapons, or blue if it's only available as blue or higher.
  This is to match how often green/blue spawns vs everything else.
  (For future iterations, I would try averaging the stats and maybe playing with spawn rates.)
- weap.py: The first version of the program.
- calc.py: Figuring out better calculations for next iteration.
- weap_scoredv1.py: Final iteration of program that uses scoring to find ideal loadout.

website_template
- A template version of website.
